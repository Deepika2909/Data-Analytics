## Features
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Dynamic Power BI dashboards showcasing churn trends and customer segments.  
- **Data Analysis:** Identification of key factors influencing customer churn.  
- **Predictive Insights:** Highlighting high-risk customer profiles for proactive intervention.  
- **Business Recommendations:** Data-driven strategies to enhance customer retention.

## Steps
1. **Data Collection:** Acquired a dataset containing customer details and churn labels.  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Cleaned and prepared data for analysis (handled missing values, duplicates, etc.).  
3. **Power BI Analysis:**  
   - Imported the dataset into Power BI.  
   - Created relationships between data tables.  
   - Built visuals like bar charts, pie charts, and trend lines to uncover patterns.  
   - Filtered data by customer segments for deeper insights.  
4. **Insights and Recommendations:**  
   - Identified major churn factors (high monthly charges, short tenure).  
   - Suggested strategies to retain at-risk customers.
